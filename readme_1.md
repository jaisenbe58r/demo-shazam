# Shazam Demo

This project is about Shazam Demo. You are going to learn how to analyze and index musics to database and search for musics in database.

## Installing

First of all, you should have installed Python version 2.7 and pip.

```
pip install numpy termcolor pyaudio wave pydub
```

## How to use

1. Run reset.py file to clear and re-initialize your database

```
python reset.py
```

2. Put your mp3 files into mp3 folder
3. Run analyze.py 

```
python analyze.py
```

4. When you see indexed musics to database and run listen.py to listen music to discover. You will have to pass a second parameter for listening offset (by default it is 10 seconds)

```
python listen.py -s 5
```

5. Done!
